# 🏆 Children's Speech Recognition Solution
## On Top of Pasketti: Children’s Speech Recognition Challenge (Word Track)

**Competition Link:** [DrivenData: On Top of Pasketti](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/308/childrens-word-asr/)

This project contains a solution for the **Word Track** of the competition. The goal is to recognize children's speech (utterances) and transcribe them into text.

### 🚀 Solution Overview
*   **Model:** OpenAI Whisper (Medium/Large)
*   **Approach:** Direct inference using pre-trained weights (bundled with submission).
*   **Framework:** PyTorch + Transformers

### 📂 File Structure
*   `submission_main.py`: The main inference script that runs on the competition server.
*   `download_model.py`: **CRITICAL SCRIPT**. Used to download the model weights and create the final `submission.zip`.
*   `submission.zip`: The final file to upload (generated by `download_model.py`).

### 🛠️ How to Submit (Step-by-Step)

Due to the large size of the model (~1.5GB - 6GB) and local environment restrictions, **we recommend generating the submission package on Google Colab.**

#### 1️⃣ Generate Submission ZIP
1.  Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2.  Upload `download_model.py` and `submission_main.py` to the Colab files area.
3.  Run the following commands in a cell:
    ```python
    !pip install torch transformers sentencepiece accelerate
    !python download_model.py --package
    ```
4.  Wait for the script to finish. It will create `submission.zip`.
5.  **Download `submission.zip`** from Colab to your computer.

#### 2️⃣ Upload to DrivenData
1.  Go to the [Submissions Page](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/308/childrens-word-asr/submissions/).
2.  Click **"Submission via File Upload"**.
3.  Upload your `submission.zip`.
4.  **Note:** It is recommended to try a "Smoke Test" first (if available) or simply submit to the main track.

### 🐛 Troubleshooting
*   **Import Errors:** If you try to run locally and get errors about `WhisperProcessor` or `torch`, your local environment has version conflicts. This is why we recommend the Colab method above.
*   **Submission Time Limit:** The competition allows 2 hours for inference. The `whisper-medium` model should fit comfortably within this limit.

### 📜 Requirements (For Reference)
*   Python 3.11+
*   `torch`
*   `transformers`
*   `torchaudio`
*   `librosa`
